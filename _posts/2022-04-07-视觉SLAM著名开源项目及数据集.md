## 开源项目

### 1 ORB-SLAM

地址：<https://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/orbslam/>

适用于单目、双目、RGB-D相机；

> ORB-SLAM is a versatile and accurate SLAM solution for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D cameras. It is able to compute in real-time the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction of the scene in a wide variety of environments, ranging from small hand-held sequences of a desk to a car driven around several city blocks.

## 数据集

### 1 BAL

全称： Bundle Adjustment in the Large

官网地址：<https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal/>

> Recent work in Structure from Motion has demonstrated the possibility of reconstructing geometry from large-scale community photo collections. Bundle adjustment, the joint non-linear refinement of camera and point parameters, is a key component of most SfM systems, and one which can consume a significant amount of time for large problems. 

看起来发布的时候是为了 SfM 任务的。发布的论文已经是 2010 年的了。
