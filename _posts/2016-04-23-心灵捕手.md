##IMPRESS

晚上10点半才开始看，因而分成了两半，感觉这样的方式也不错。

1. `Skylar`与Will的对白

    " 

    But I can't and that's my life and I deal with it. 

    "

    好一个**deal with**，以前我觉得**accept**就足够了，却不想原来还有更高的层次。

2. Sean与Will的对白

    
    “

    Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.
    
    Stayed up half the night thinking about it.

    Something occurred to me.

    I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since.

    “

    
    “
    You're just a kid.

    You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.

    You've never been out of Boston.

    So if I asked you about art you'd probably give me the skinny...on every art book ever written.

    Michelangelo? You know a lot about him.Life's work political aspirations. Him and the pope...Sexual orientation. The whole works right?

    I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

    You never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

    If I ask you about women.

    you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites.

    You may have even been laid a few times.

    But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman... and feel truly happy.

    You're a tough kid.

    I ask you about war you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me right?
    
    "Once more into the breach dear friends."

    But you've never been near one.

    You've never held your best friend's head in your lap...

    and watch him gasp his last breath lookin' to you for help.

    If I asked you about love you'd probably quote me a sonnet.

    But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable.

    Known someone that could level you with her eyes.

    Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth just for you.

    Who could rescue you from the depths of hell.

    And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel.

    To have that love for her be there forever.

    Through anything. Through cancer.

    And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand.

    because the doctors could see in your eyes...

    that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.

    You don't know about real loss

    'cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself.

    I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.

    I look at you. I don't see an intelligent confident man.I see a cocky scared shitless kid.

3. Sean以Will的对白

    “

    People call these things "imperfections".

    But they're not. That's the good stuff.

    And then we get to choose who we let into our weird little worlds.
    
    “

    "
    You're not perfect sport.

    This girl you met she isn't perfect either.

    But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.

    That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about.

    "
    
    关于亲密关系。小瑕疵、不完美，but " perfect for each other ".

4. `Lambeau`与Will对白

    “
    
    I can't do this proof

    but you can. And when it comes to that

    it's only about just a handful of people in the world who can tell the difference between you and me.

    But I'm one of them.

    Most days I wish I never met you

    because then I could sleep at night.

    I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge that there was someone like you out there.

    I didn't have to watch you throw it all away.

    
    “
    
    蓝博教授的颓丧，感慨自己曾经引以为傲的天赋现在不值一提；感慨天才肆意浪费。

5. Sean与Will的对白

    “
    
    What are you passionate about? What do you want?

    “

    同时还谈了工作选择的问题。

6.  Lambeau 与 Sean 的对白

    "

    You think I'm a failure. I know who I am.

    I'm proud of what I do.

    It was a conscious choice.

    I didn't fuck up!

    "

7.  Sean与Will的对白

    “
    
    Look at me son. It's not your fault.

    No. It's not your fault.

    No no you don't. It's not your fault.

    It's not your fault.

    It's not your fault.

    It's not your fault.

    It's not your fault.

    It's not your fault.

    It's not your fault.

    Fuck them okay?
