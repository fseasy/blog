    <h2>Risks <em>--Jeffrey Kastne</em></h2>
    <p>To <strong>laugh</strong> is to risk appearing a fool
    <p>To <strong>weep</strong> is to risk appearing sentimental
    <p>To reach out for another is to risk involvement
    <p>To expose feelings is to risk rejection
    <p>To place your dreams before the crowd is to risk ridicule
    <p><strong>To love is to risk not being loved in return</strong>
    <p>But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing
    <p>The person who risks nothing , does nothing , has nothing , is nothing
    <p>He may aviod suffering and sorrow
    <p>Chained by his certitudes , he's a slave
    <p>He has forfeited his freedom
    <p>Only a person who takes risks is free
