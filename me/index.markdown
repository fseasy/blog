  To laugh is to risk appearing a fool
  To weep is to risk appearing sentimental
  To reach out for another is to risk involvement
  To expose feelings is to risk rejection
  To place your dreams before the crowd is to risk ridicule
  To love is to risk not being loved in reture
  But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing
  The person who risks nothing , does nothing , has nothing , is nothing
  He may aviod suffering and sorrow
  Chained by his certitudes , he's a slave
  He has forfeited his freedom
  Only a person who takes risks is free
                                      --Risks , Jeffrey Kastner

我不是一个喜欢冒险的人。但是，总是在笑，哭；想要去感受别人，想要表达自己的感情；热血的时候喜欢说些真切的感受；也曾一直有荒谬的行为想去追求爱情。

**或许我是一个愿意冒险的人。**

然而现在却越来越趋于保守。呆在自己的舒适区里。所以感觉思考能力、记忆能力、执行力越来越下降了。

大学几年，开始时一直在寻求归属感，为此惴惴不安；后来当终于肯安心做自己时，越来越觉得满足，生活也快乐很多。然不想却又忘掉自己的位置。
从自以为是到自我否定，不过是转眼之间。然后又是漫长的自我重建。

希望一切都好~
