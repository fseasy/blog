<!-- because of GFW, some google resource (say, cse) can be recheachable and make the window 
    loading for may seconds!
    it block the window.onload, and affect the experience even though we have make the script be async.
    so we here use window.stop to quilick stop the loading action.
-->

<script>
(function(){
    var _WAIT_MS = 3000;
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.debug("window stop quickly in ", _WAIT_MS)
        window.stop();
    }, _WAIT_MS)
})()
