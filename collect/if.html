    <h2>If <em>--Joseph Rudyard Kipling</em></h2>
    <p>If you keep your head when all about you 
    <p>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
    <p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    <p>But make allowance for their doubting too;
    <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    <p>Or , being lied about , don't deal in lies ,
    <p>Or , being hated , don't give way to hating ,
    <p>And yet <strong>don't look too good , nor talk too wise </strong>;
    <p>
    <p><strong>If you dream -- and not make dream your master</strong> ;
    <p><strong>If you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim </strong>;
    <p><strong>If you can meet with triumpth and disaster</strong>
    <p><strong>And treat those two imposters just the same </strong>;
    <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
    <p>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
    <p>Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
    <p>And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;
    <p>
    <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    <p>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss , 
    <p>And lose , and start again at your beginnings
    <p><strong>And never breathe a word about your loss </strong>;
    <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    <p>To serve your turn long after they are gone ,
    <p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
    <p>Except the Will which says to them : "Hold on" ;
    <p>
    <p><strong>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue</strong> ,
    <p><strong>Or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch</strong> ;
    <p>If neigher foes nor loving friends can hurt you ;
    <p>If all men count with you , but none too much ;
    <p><strong>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</strong>
    <p><strong>With sixty seconds' worth of distance run </strong>--
    <p>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it ,
    <p>And -- which is more -- you'll be a Man my son !
